Northwestern Project

This is the repository for our first group project.  
A few points:
1)	The PowerPoint file (Project 1 Presentation.pptx) contains the slides we used to tell the story.  
2)	The file, “cancer_polution_Final.ipynb”, was the main Jupyter notebook we used to run our code.  
3)	An analysis of tobacco use was included in the PowerPoint slides but the code used is in the notebook, “cancer_smoke.ipynb”.

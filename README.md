# The Effect of Air Pollution and Smoking Habits on Cancer and Stroke Incidence Rates 
## Background
A statistical analysis and visualization exercise that explores the relationship of air pollution and smoking habits on the incidence of various diseases in the United  States per county. A project designed to find correlation through the cross-examination of all possible variables regarding smoking habits, types of air pollution, 3 different cancer types and stroke rates.

## Process:
Import pandas and matplotlib libraries to explore data from the 'United States Environmental Protection Agency Centers for Disease Control and Prevention' and 'United States Cancer Statistics (USCS)'. Notable fields include 'Days with AQI', 'Good Days', 'Moderate Days', 'Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups Days', 'Unhealthy Days', 'Very Unhealthy Days', 'Hazardous Days', 'Max AQI', '90th Percentile AQI', 'Median AQI', 'Days CO', 'Days NO2', 'Days Ozone', 'Days SO2', 'Days PM2.5', 'Days PM10'.

## A paragraph from an article, Fox News
Oddly, smokers don't seem to be at increased risk for melanoma. In fact, some studies have suggested they might even have a smaller chance of getting the disease -- although scientists are still trying to figure out if that's really true.

## Steps:
- To research various cancer, air pollution, and smoking habit data
- To create pandas dataframe merging all pertinent information on county names
- To create Matplotlib and Seaborn charts and run correlation tables to get stummary statistics

## A few notes:
1)	The PowerPoint file (Project 1 Presentation.pptx) contains the slides we used to tell the story.  
2)	The file, “cancer_polution_Final.ipynb”, was the main Jupyter notebook we used to run our code.  
3)	An analysis of tobacco use was included in the PowerPoint slides but the code used is in the notebook, “cancer_smoke.ipynb”.
